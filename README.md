# ==================== Class =====================
## Disease-associated polymorphism (DP)
    A polymorphism reported to be in significant association with a disease/phenotype (p<0.05) that is assumed to be functional (e.g. as a consequence of location, evolutionary conservation, replication studies etc), although there may as yet be no direct evidence (e.g. from an expression study) of a functional effect.


## Disease-associated polymorphism with additional supporting functional evidence (DFP)
    A polymorphism reported to be in significant association with disease (p<0.05) that has evidence of being of direct functional importance (e.g. as a consequence of altered expression, mRNA studies etc).

## In vitro/laboratory or in vivo functional polymorphism (FP)
    A polymorphism reported to affect the structure, function or expression of the gene (or gene product), but with no disease association reported as yet.
> Please note: In the opinion of the HGMD curators, the polymorphism data present in HGMD should always be viewed with caution, due to (i) the possibility that the observed disease association may be simply due to a linkage disequilibrium effect, rather than a bone fide underlying functional mechanism and (ii) in vitro studies are not invariably accurate indicators of the in vivo situation.

## Frameshift or truncating variant (FTV)
    A polymorphic or rare variant reported in the literature (e.g. detected in the process of whole genome/exome screening) that is predicted to truncate or otherwise alter the gene product (i.e. a nonsense or frameshift variant) but with no disease association reported as yet. Please note that any variant affecting the obligate donor/acceptor splice site of a gene will not be included in this category unless there is evidence for an effect on the splicing phenotype. Variants occurring in pseudogenes will also be excluded unless evidence for a functional effect is present for both the pseudogene itself2 and the variant in question.

## Disease causing mutation ? (DM?)
    Likely pathological mutation reported to be disease causing in the corresponding report, but where the author has indicated that there may be some degree of doubt, or subsequent evidence has come to light in the literature, calling the deleterious nature of the variant into question.

## Disease causing mutation (DM)
    Pathological mutation reported to be disease causing in the corresponding report (i.e. all other HGMD data).

## Retired entry (R)
    A variant entry retired from HGMD due to being found to have been erroneously included ab initio, or a variant that has been subjected to correction in the literature resulting in the record becoming obsolete, merged or otherwise invalid.
